    <h1>Fix google font</h1>
    <p>Due to GDPR rulings, you can not let your website load google fonts. This module downloads google fonts to your server before passing them on to the user, protecting the user from sending any privacy protected data to a third party.</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>This module hooks into the generation of Odoo's fontend css and replaces the urls of google fonts with relative urls to your webserver. Additionally your webserver acts as a proxy parsing googles font page and pasing it to the enduser.</p>
    <h3>Info</h3>
    <p><strong>This plugin only removes the calls to google for visitors. It does not remove the google fonts loading from the editor mode since this is only available for website administrators.</strong></p>
    <p>If you need this module for a different version of Odoo send a mail to contact@bytist.de</p>

    <h2>Important notice for Odoo17 (and Odoo16)</h2>
    <p>Since Odoo16 it is possible to add GoogleFonts locally via Odoo's Webeditor. When you select a font scroll down in the list until you see "Add a Google Font". In the popup disable the switch "Serve font from Google Servers". Due to this feature there are currently no plans to update this module. If you need further assistance with google fonts please send an email to contact@bytist.de</p>
